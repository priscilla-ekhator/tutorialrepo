Beneath the silver moon's soft, gentle light,
A world of tales comes to life each night.
By the fireside, where shadows dance and play,
We gather 'round to hear what storytellers say.

They spin their yarns of old, of love and lore,
Of ancient kingdoms and adventures galore.
In whispers, legends of heroes are retold,
Their deeds and trials, more precious than gold.

The moonlight weaves its magic, pure and bright,
As tales by moonlight take flight into the night.
With every word, the darkness co
Beneath the silver moon's soft, gentle light,
A world of tales comes to life each night.
By the fireside, where shadows dance and play,
We gather 'round to hear what storytellers say.

This is a wrong line

The moonlight weaves its magic, pure and bright,
As tales by moonlight take flight into the night.
With every word, the darkness comes alive,
And in our hearts, these stories forever thrive.

Each story is a treasure, a gift from the past,
A mirror to our souls, where memories are cast.
The moon, a silent witness to these tales we share,
Its gentle glow a reminder of the stories we bear.

Under the moon's embrace, we find our delight,
In the enchanting world of tales by moonlight.
For as long as the moon in the sky does gleam,
These stories will forever be our cherished dream.
